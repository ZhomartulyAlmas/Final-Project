Project Description :

As a result of the global pandemic in the Republic of Kazakhstan, everything has switched to remote control, we have identified that some areas are still not ready for such rapid changes in society. That’s the main reason why we decided to do something that will help in this difficult situation. As we know, in Kazakhstan we had a quarantine mode for a few months and we still have a quarantine mode in some regions but not as strict as it was a few months ago. And that‘s why people simply started to order the delivery for food, groceries and etc. But we didn’t have an option to order medicine. And even buying medicine was a catastrophic problem, because it was really hard to even find it. We had a shortage of medicine in our country. And that’s why a lot of people died. So in this project, we tried to ease that problem so that people in our country could easily buy or order medicine.

Basically, we are planning to create a website with a beautiful and easy-to-use user interface. We want to create a website so that, any category of people can easily use it. Potential clients can order any medicine which is available to any address in Almaty(in this project we only cover Almaty). Clients can see how many medicines are in stock right now. We will include the text field indicating the total price of medicines in the basket. And we will add a most-sold and recently-sold medicine list on the main page. So that users can see which medicines are highly demanded and which medicines are sold recently. After completing the purchase client can remove any medicine from his/her basket and finally fill out the address, phone number, bank card information, etc, and order medicine. If an order is successful then the client will receive an email, with the detailed info of the purchase. 

In this project we are going to use the JAVA as a programming language and we will use Tomcat as a open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and WebSocket technologies. As a database we will use Oracle. The main reason why we are going to use JAVA as a PL and Oracle as a DB is because we have a solid foundation of it from our experience in university. As a software architectural design we are planning to use MVC model, where we will split up the application data, the user interface, and control logic. To make our proect more realistic we will fetch the real data from [AptekaPlus](https://aptekaplus.kz) online pharmacy. All the medicine names, price, bar code, etc are going to be real.
